# Car-price-prediction-ML-Using-Regression-
This notebook demonstrates a complete workflow for predicting car prices using a regression model in Python. Key steps include:

Data Analysis: Explores relationships between car features and prices, highlighting the impact of engine size, year, and mileage.

Preprocessing: Cleans missing values, transforms features, and prepares data for modeling.

Model Building: Implements and evaluates a regression algorithm, showing performance using metrics and diagnostic visualizations.

Results: Both actual and predicted price distributions are visualized using KDE plots, illustrating the model’s strong ability to generalize and accurately predict prices on test data.

Conclusion: The close match between predicted and actual values shows effective model performance. The approach can be refined further with additional features or advanced algorithms.
